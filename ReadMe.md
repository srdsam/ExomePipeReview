# Exome Pipe Review

## Introduction

This is a website that allows geneticists to review Exomiser analysis of subject's exomes for likely causative variants in their disease phenotype. This project has been split into two main directories:

- exome-api: *The backend API which serves exomiser analysis to the frontend*
- exome-client: *Frontend of website built in ReactJS*

Further details on launching the project are found in [exome-api](exome-api/ReadMe.md) and [exome-client](exome-client/ReadMe.md)

## JSON Data Specifications for Database

Much of the code is based around reading the JSON correctly, so it is important this remains consistent.

- JSON generated by Exomiser 12.1.0.
- VCFs for Exomiser generated by nf-core/sarek (using GRCh37, HaplotypeCaller, and snpEff)

## Ideas for future development

- Prettify reactJS frontend
- Move users list into the database
